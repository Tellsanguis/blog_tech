# Future Homelab - OpenTofu, K3S, Ansible & DevOps

Documentation of the migration to a modern infrastructure based on Kubernetes and DevOps practices.

## Vision

Evolve my homelab towards an infrastructure that is:
- **Cloud-native** with Kubernetes (K3S)
- **Infrastructure as Code** with OpenTofu
- **Highly automated** with Ansible and GitOps
- **Observable** with advanced monitoring and logging

## Target Tech Stack

### Orchestration
- **K3S**: Lightweight and performant Kubernetes distribution
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps for continuous deployment

### Infrastructure as Code
- **OpenTofu**: Open-source fork of Terraform for IaC
- **Ansible**: Configuration management and provisioning
- **Git**: Version control for all infrastructure

### DevOps & CI/CD
- **Forgejo Actions**: Integrated CI/CD
- **GitOps**: Declarative and versioned deployment
- **Kustomize**: Kubernetes configuration management

### Observability
- **Prometheus**: Metrics and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboards
- **Loki**: Log aggregation
- **Tempo**: Distributed tracing

## Migration Goals

### Technical
- Horizontal scalability
- High availability
- Automated deployments
- Complete observability

### Learning
- Master Kubernetes in production
- Practice Infrastructure as Code
- Implement DevOps best practices
- Explore cloud-native technologies

## Roadmap

The migration happens in stages:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic K3S setup
2. **Phase 2**: Migration of critical services
3. **Phase 3**: GitOps implementation (ArgoCD)
4. **Phase 4**: Observability and monitoring
5. **Phase 5**: Complete automation with OpenTofu

Each step is documented with encountered challenges and solutions provided.

## Why This Evolution?

This migration represents:
- **Professional skills**: Technologies used in enterprise
- **Practical learning**: Experimentation in real conditions
- **Technical evolution**: Moving to modern and scalable solutions
- **Portfolio**: Demonstration of advanced DevOps skills
